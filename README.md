ChessGame
=========

In this chess game, no graphics are used at all, only characters are used to represent the chess board. Furthermore, 
King, Queen and other members are represented by a box(7 x 5 array of chars). 
Also, you can't use mouse to move king, queen or other members, you have to enter the horizontal and vertical location
to refer to any king ,queen or any other member. 

When & How I developed this game ?

I developed this game, when i was taking my first C++ class in Fall 2011. It was not an assignment,
but, i just did this for fun. At that time, i was not aware of Object Oriented programming and not 
even open GL libraries. So, i just used characters to represent chess board, and used only functions to 
develop this game.
